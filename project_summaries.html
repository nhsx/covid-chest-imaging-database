<p>The core of the NCCID initiative is to provide value to the public in response to the COVID-19 crisis.
For this reason, NCCID wishes to share information on how the data is being utilised by approved institutions and researcherts, to inform the wider community of patients, staff and interested public.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the projects currently ongoing.</p>
<div class="section" id="university-college-london">
<h2>University College London<a class="headerlink" href="#university-college-london" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>University College London plans to store the NCCID data in a highly secure XNAT repository to enable imaging-based research at UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC). In particular, researchers at CMIC will use these data to build artificial intelligence models to automatically detect COVID-19 patients based on their CT or X-ray images, such that, in the future, these images can be screened automatically before doctors read them. This will significantly save time in managing future outbreaks. The research also involves building computational models to analyse the outcomes for those with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, predicting best management for individual patients. These predictions may shorten their hospital stay, reduce complications and even save lives. Finally, the project will investigates methods to deploy these developed models to local hospitals quickly and safely.</p>

<h2>University of Cambridge<a class="headerlink" href="#university-of-cambridge" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is strongly believed that early detection of COVID-19 and intervention leads to lower Covid-19 mortality because it enables disease treatment via
oxygen therapy and control of spread via isolation. The diagnosis of COVID-19 must be confirmed by reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene sequencing for respiratory or blood specimens. However, testing the general population is proving to be
very challenging because of various reasons including limitations of sample collection and transportation, kit performance and availability,
limitations in capacity, etc.</p>
<p>Chest scans could include x-rays, CT and MRI scans. Chest CT scans are used to examine lung tissues and often used for further investigation after
an abnormal chest x-ray. Chest MRI scans provide a detailed picture of the chest wall, heart, and blood vessels. These scans are carried out routinely
for a variety of medical reasons, including preparation for surgery, annual follow-ups, accident and emergency, etc. The creation of computer systems that can automatically process these scans to detect and identify signs of Covid-19 can provide added value for the NHS with no significant additional burden on staff, resources, operational costs, etc. The development of these systems require the implementation of cutting-edge image processing and artificial intelligence technologies.</p>
<p>X-ray images and CT scans can also be useful in monitoring the progression of Covid-19 patients as they can reveal if their lungs are filled with sticky mucus that can lead to breathing problems and provide a benchmark for comparisons with previous scans.</p>
<p>This project aims to find the visual signatures of Covid-19, as they appear in chest scans, that can lead to accurate diagnostic and prognosis for use in
hospital settings. Automated imaging algorithms, aided by advanced artificial intelligence techniques, can detect some of the abnormal features
appearing in these scans, such as ground glass patterned areas, Ground glass, Crazy paving, Vascular dilatation, Traction Bronchiectasis. These features are generally not specific to Covid-19 and could be seen with other infections. Hence, it is important to develop AI techniques to aid the imaging analysis to increase the accuracy of diagnostic.</p>

<p>Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious, and severe cases can lead to pneumonia and ultimately death. The diagnosis can be confirmed by laboratory testing; however, the test has low sensitivity which leads to late diagnosis and treatment. Chest X-rays and CT scans provide valuable diagnostic and monitoring information that can complement the laboratory and clinical data. In this project, we propose to develop an open-source artificial intelligence tool that combines chest imaging data and clinical data to support the diagnosis, triaging and prognosis for COVID-19 in the UK. This will make clinical decisions more efficient, accurate, timely, and potentially cheaper, leading to better patient outcomes.</p>

<h2>V7<a class="headerlink" href="#v7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://v7labs.com">V7 Labs</a> is predicting the severity and likelihood of ICU admission of patients via chest x-rays using a deep image retrieval method. By collaborating with NHSx, the San Matteo hospital of Pavia, and multiple international collaborators, they have assembled over 9,000 comparable patient cases, of which over 2,000 are confirmed to have COVID-19. Among these V7’s model has learned to assess the patient’s severity, and whether the patient is at risk of entering the ICU solely based on a single chest x-ray and their patient profile. The AI model currently predicts whether a patient will enter the ICU with 85% accuracy when a first x-ray is taken, based on a validation set of 200 unseen cases from Italy, the UK, and US of varying ethnicities and ages.</p>
<p>V7’s approach involved the extraction of the lungs from a patient’s x-ray to avoid any potential forms of bias. By analysing only the status of pixels inside the lungs, V7’s AI is not able to deduct (and therefore “cheat”) whether a patient is supine, elderly, or had their x-ray taken with a portable scanner. This approach solely observes the patient’s normalised lungs, alongside any quantitative readings taken at the hospital.</p>
<p>The image retrieval component of the AI also presents the 5 most-similar cases to the patient, enabling a deeper level of explainability than simple regions of interest (ROI) on the image. This allows clinician to observe the patient pathway taken by other highly correlated cases.
By solely relying on one x-ray, the AI model is able to predict ICU admission with an 85% accuracy rate. The team is now adding additional data to this baseline score to push results to an even higher level and detect potential edge cases.</p>

<h2>Aidence<a class="headerlink" href="#aidence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Chest CT scans are used in hospitals across the globe to image the severity of COVID-19 lung involvement and guide the appropriate patient management. Artificial intelligence (AI) designed for radiologists can increase the speed of reporting on these scans and support timely patient
triaging.</p>
<p>Aidence has set-up an international consortium, ICOVAI, to create an AI solution for COVID-19 on chest CTs. The consortium is a collaboration between clinical centers, hospitals, AI companies, and distribution partners.</p>
<p>ICOVAI’s AI solution will automatically detect COVID-19 on chest CTs and assess the extent of lung tissue affected. Its quantitative analysis can be used to guide hospital management, such as bed capacity on wards, or predicting the need for ICU care.</p>
<p>The consortium aims to reduce the workload and pressure that the medical staff are facing during the pandemic. The software will be particularly useful when test kits are absent or inconclusive, and when radiologists are unavailable or lack specific COVID-19 training.</p>
<p>To train a well-performing model, ICOVAI is using high-quality datasets from diverse CT scanners, hospitals, and countries. The patient data is anonymised and processed in line with the GDPR. The product will comply with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR), 2017/745, to ensure clinical safety and quality.</p>
<p>The AI solution will be made available not-for-profit for the NHS and European hospitals. The project is backed by the EU.</p>

<h2>City Data Science Institute<a class="headerlink" href="#city-data-science-institute" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The City Data Science Institute are using the NCCID dataset to develop artificial intelligence systems that offer explainable decision making. More specifically, we are investigating the key radiological findings of Covid-19, how this can change over time, and how this differs from other disease findings upon a chest X-ray. Using state-of-the-art generative networks, we aim to learn more about the Covid-19 disease process and facilitate medical decision making.</p>
<p>The chest X-ray is a readily available investigation and is useful in the identification, severity assessment and monitoring of Covid-19. It is more readily available than CT scanning and able to exclude other important conditions that may present. The use of AI to assess chest X-rays can facilitate medical staff and improve patient outcomes.</p>
<p>We have begun using a particular type of artificial intelligence model that is able to learn what an X-ray should appear like if it were to be healthy or more diseased. This will help the research community learn about subtle disease features and can contribute to more accurate and quicker automatic diagnostics. One of our main goals is for our system to offer a counterfactual explanation as to why the artificial intelligence has made certain decisions. This is vital in developing safe and effective AI.</p>

<p>To test, evaluate and further finetune a software which can automatically analyse Chest X-ray  images to identify absence or presence of features of COVID-19 infection. The software can detect  other lung conditions such as pneumonia caused by viral or bacterial infections. The software is  being further developed to identify other key conditions such as lesion and enlarged heart. The  software utilises a number of mathematical models for image analysis and is capable of offering a  high confidence classification with minimum false positives or false negatives.</p>
<p>Ultimate objective is integrating it into the NHS radiology reporting workflow to provide a prompt  computer aided prediction alongside the radiologist’s own report. By providing an extra layer of  support to the clinical team, patient triage and access to appropriate treatment can be speed up.  Saving time, resources and most importantly, improving patient experience.</p>
<p>Other application of the software is to provide preliminary / indicative prediction to the primary care  team in remote locations and community hospitals to assist in identifying in the community cases  which may need urgent specialist attention in main hospitals.</p>

<h2>Universities of Brighton, Oxford, Glasgow, Lincoln and Sheffield<a class="headerlink" href="#universities-of-brighton-oxford-glasgow-lincoln-and-sheffield" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Members of this collaboration were instrumental in winning first place in ‘<a class="reference external" href="https://devpost.com/software/europa-mapp-predicting-stopping-covid19-waves-pandemics">Coronahackathon</a>’ April 2020, for the development of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict patients with SARS-CoV-2 virus using full blood count results. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibit a characteristic change in different parameters measured in simple and rapid blood tests to a high accuracy, predicting the virus in regular wards (93-94%) and those in the community (80-86%).</p>
<p>Our project will validate these initial results and enable use in current hospital practice to screen patients and identify those needing full diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2. Expertise in chest images, blood science and modelling ML and AI will develop an innovative tool to upscale screening to identify individuals for full rt-PCR testing of the virus potentially up to one week earlier than rt-PCR, which will allow much faster release of the country (and the world) from lockdown, protection against future waves and future pandemics.</p>

<h2>Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust<a class="headerlink" href="#ashford-and-st-peters-hospitals-nhs-foundation-trust" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Chest X-rays are often one of the first tests used to help guide doctors with deciding how likely a patient is to have COVID-19 and also how severe the infection is. We are aiming to see how accurate chest X-rays are for detecting COVID-19 and telling doctors how severe the disease is. We plan to answer this by having doctors specialising in X-rays assess chest X-rays of patients in the national COVID-19 imaging database and then compare this assessment to clinical details, such as if they had COVID-19 and how well they did in hospital. We hope this will give us a better understanding of chest X-ray accuracy in COVID-19 and appearances that are linked to COVID-19 or more severe infection. We also additionally aim to use Neural networks (advanced computational algorithms) on the chest X-rays in the database to see if these can be used to automatically detect COVID-19 in chest X-rays. This research will hopefully one day help with the development of clinical algorithms and technology that can be used to speed up chest X-ray assessment for COVID-19.</p>
